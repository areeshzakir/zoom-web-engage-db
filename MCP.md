\
> Learn how to install, configure, and use Factory Bridge to connect Factory with your local environment\
\
Factory Bridge creates a secure connection between the Factory platform and your local machine, enabling powerful capabilities like running CLI commands, managing local processes, and accessing local resources directly from your Factory sessions.\
\
### System Requirements\
\
Factory Bridge is available for MacOS and supported on most browsers except Safari and Brave.\
\
## Installation\
\
<Steps>\
  <Step title="Download Factory Bridge">\
    Download the Factory Bridge from the "Connect to Machine" -> "Local Machine" menu in the top-right corner of a Factory session.\
  </Step>\
\
  <Step title="Install Factory Bridge">\
    **macOS**\
\
    * Open the downloaded `.zip` file\
    * Drag Factory Bridge to your Applications folder\
  </Step>\
</Steps>\
\
## Getting Started\
\
<Steps>\
  <Step title="Launch Factory Bridge">\
    If Factory Bridge isn't already running, launch it from your applications menu or folder. Look for the Factory Bridge icon in your system tray or menu bar to confirm it's running.\
\
    <Note>\
      Factory Bridge runs in the background and manages its own window state. You can always access it by clicking on the tray icon.\
    </Note>\
  </Step>\
\
  <Step title="Enter Pairing Code">\
    When you first launch Factory Bridge, you'll be prompted to enter a pairing code:\
\
    1. Open Factory in your browser\
    2. Navigate to a session where you want to use local capabilities\
    3. Click on the CPU button in the top right of the session view, click "Local Machine"\
    4. Factory will display a pairing code\
    5. Enter this code in the Factory Bridge application\
\
    The pairing code ensures a secure connection between Factory and your local machine.\
  </Step>\
\
  <Step title="Confirm Connection">\
    Once successfully paired:\
\
    1. The Factory Bridge interface will display "Bridge Paired" with a green indicator\
    2. Factory will show that Bridge is connected in the session\
    3. You can now access local capabilities in your Factory session\
  </Step>\
</Steps>\
\
## Use Cases\
\
### Running Local CLI Commands\
\
Factory Bridge allows you to execute local CLI commands directly from Factory sessions, making it easy to interact with your local development environment.\
\
<CardGroup cols=\{2\}>\
  <Card title="Execute Commands" icon="terminal">\
    Run commands on your local machine:\
\
    ```\
    npm install react\
    python -m venv myenv\
    git status\
    ```\
\
    Factory will display the command output in real-time.\
  </Card>\
\
  <Card title="Navigate Local Filesystem" icon="folder-tree">\
    Navigate and interact with your local filesystem:\
\
    ```\
    ls -la\
    cd my-project\
    mkdir new-folder\
    ```\
\
    Commands execute in your specified working directory.\
  </Card>\
</CardGroup>\
\
### Managing Local Processes\
\
<Steps>\
  <Step title="Start Processes">\
    Launch local servers, build processes, or any long-running tasks:\
\
    ```\
    npm start\
    python manage.py runserver\
    docker-compose up\
    ```\
  </Step>\
\
  <Step title="Monitor Output">\
    View real-time stdout and stderr output from the running process directly in Factory.\
  </Step>\
\
  <Step title="Interact with Processes">\
    Send input to running processes as needed, such as responding to prompts or entering commands.\
  </Step>\
\
  <Step title="Terminate Processes">\
    Easily stop processes when you're done or need to restart them.\
  </Step>\
</Steps>\
\
### Development Workflow Integration\
\
<AccordionGroup>\
  <Accordion title="Local Server Development">\
    Run a local development server and interact with it directly through Factory:\
\
    1. Start your development server via Factory Bridge\
    2. Make code changes in Factory\
    3. See real-time output from your server\
    4. Test your changes without switching contexts\
  </Accordion>\
\
  <Accordion title="Build and Test Processes">\
    Run build processes, test suites, and CI tasks locally:\
\
    1. Execute build commands through Factory\
    2. Review build output in real-time\
    3. Run tests and analyze results\
    4. Fix issues without leaving Factory\
  </Accordion>\
\
  <Accordion title="Environment Setup">\
    Configure development environments directly from Factory:\
\
    1. Create and activate virtual environments\
    2. Install dependencies\
    3. Set up configuration files\
    4. Initialize projects\
  </Accordion>\
</AccordionGroup>\
\
## Troubleshooting\
\
<AccordionGroup>\
  <Accordion title="Connection Issues">\
    If Factory can't connect to Bridge:\
\
    1. Ensure Factory Bridge is running (check your system tray)\
    2. Verify you've entered the correct pairing code\
    3. Restart Factory Bridge and try again\
    4. Check if you have too many sessions open (current limit is 6 concurrent connections)\
  </Accordion>\
\
  <Accordion title="Missing Tool Options">\
    If CLI tools don't appear in Factory:\
\
    1. Make sure the MCP Bridge feature flag is enabled\
    2. Refresh your Factory session\
    3. Check that you're using Droid Mode in the model selection dropdown\
  </Accordion>\
\
  <Accordion title="Process Management Issues">\
    If you encounter issues with process execution:\
\
    1. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run the command\
    2. Check that required dependencies are installed\
    3. Verify the working directory exists and is accessible\
    4. Use absolute paths instead of relative paths for greater reliability\
  </Accordion>\
</AccordionGroup>\
\
## Security Considerations\
\
Factory Bridge establishes a secure local connection between your machine and Factory. Here's what you should know:\
\
* Bridge runs only on your local machine and doesn't expose your system to the internet\
* All commands are executed with your user permissions only\
* The pairing code ensures only authorized Factory sessions can connect\
* You maintain full control over which processes are executed\
